# SSL certificates are generated at deployment time by certbot or Let's Encrypt
# NEVER commit private keys (privkey.pem, fullchain.pem with private key, *.key)
# 
# For local testing:
#   - Use self-signed certificates: scripts/init-ssl.sh
#   - For production: Certbot will auto-generate and renew via Let's Encrypt
#
# This directory is for reference only. Actual certificates are generated during deployment.
