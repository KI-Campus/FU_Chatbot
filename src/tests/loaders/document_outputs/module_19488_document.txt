Module Name: Programming Exercise 0

--- Book (4 Kapitel) ---
=== Kapitel: Kapitel 287 ===

1. Introduction




This programming exercise is to set you up and give you an idea how the programming exercises will look like. During the course, you will then implement various concepts from the different modules.


Please download the
 
programming code
 before starting. You can also download the 
programming exercise description
, if you prefer that to clicking through this book. The contents will be the same.


Disclaimer


We are reusing a project from 
UC Berkeley
 and its updated version. The whole documentation can be found 
here
. The required code is available 
here
.
If you encounter any bugs, please report them to franziska.neuhof@l3s.de.


Python Installation


To participate in the programming exercises, you need a 
python3
 environment of the version python 3.6 or higher. Additionally you will need 
pip
 or
 
conda
. You can check via 
python -V
 or 
python3 -V
 your python version and with 
conda -V
 or 
pip -V
 / 
pip3 -V
 your conda or pip version.


If you need to install python, I personally suggest to use conda, which automatically comes with python. Installation instructions for Windows, Mac and Linux can be found 
here
.


If there is a 
tkinter
 import error, it’s likely because Python is atypical, and from Homebrew. Uninstall that and install python from Homebrew with tkinter support, or use the another installer.


When running the autograder you might encounter an exception on modern python versions. The cause of this is that the method 
cgi.escape
 has been deprecated sine 2011 and removed with Python 3.8. To fix this you can either use an earlier version (3.6 works fine) or make the following two changes to the autograder: Replace 
import cgi
 with 
from html import escape
. Replace 
message = cgi.escape(message)
 with 
message = escape(message)
.


Programming Exercise Structure & Autograding


You can check you progress by running the following command: 
python autograder.py 


Files you will edit:






addition.py






buyLotsOfFruit.py






shopSmart.py






Files you might want to look at:






shop.py






Do not change any other files and do not change any of the provided function names as this will create problems for the autograder and you will not be able to check your progress.

Project Structure & Autograding
If you download the exercise files, you will see that it contains many files. Most of them
are not relevant to you and you can just ignore them. Files you will edit:
addition.py
buyLotsOfFruit.py
shopSmart.py
Additional interesting files:
shop.py
Do not change any other files and do not change any of the provided function names
as this will create problems for the autograder and you will not be able to check your
progress.
To check your progress in solving the exercise run
python autograder.py
If you need a basic introduction to python, please check here.
Question 1: Addition
Open the file addition.py and look at the definition of add :
def add(a, b):
"Return the sum of a and b"
"*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
return 0
When you run the autograder it calls this function with different values for a and b, but
the code always returns 0. Modify the code so that it returns the sum of a and b instead
of 0.
Run the autograder using
python autograder.py -q q1
All the tests should pass now. If you have problmes you can add print() statements in
the function to help you debugging.
Question 2: buyLotsofFruits
Implement the buyLotsOfFruit(orderList) function in buyLotsOfFruit.py which takes
a list of (fruit,numPounds) tuples and returns the cost of your list. If there is some fruit
in the list which doesn’t appear in fruitPrices it should print an error message and
return None. Please do not change the fruitPrices variable.

Run python autograder.py -q q2 until question 2 passes all tests and you get full marks.
Each test will confirm that buyLotsOfFruit(orderList) returns the correct answer given
various possible inputs. For example, test_cases/q2/food_price1.test tests whether
the cost of [(’apples’, 2.0), (’pears’, 3.0), (’limes’, 4.0)] is 12.25.
Question 3: shopSmart
Fill in the function shopSmart(orderList,fruitShops) in shopSmart.py , which takes
an orderList (like the kind passed in to FruitShop.getPriceOfOrder ) and a list of
FruitShop and returns the FruitShop where your order costs the least amount in total.
Don’t change the file name or variable names, as otherwisethe autograder will have
problems.
Run python autograder.py -q q3 until question 3 passes all tests and you get full marks.
Each test will confirm that shopSmart(orderList,fruitShops) returns the correct answer
given various possible inputs.

=== Kapitel: Kapitel 288 ===

2. Task: Addition
Open the file 
addition.py 
and look at the definition of 
add
:
def add(a, b):
    "Return the sum of a and b"
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
    return 0


When you run the autograder it calls this function with different values for a and b, but the code always returns 0. Modify the code so that it returns the sum of a and b instead of 0.
Run the autograder using
python autograder.py -q q1


All the tests should pass now. If you have problems you can add 
print()
 statements in the function to help you debugging.

=== Kapitel: Kapitel 289 ===

3. Task: By Lots of Fruit
Implement the 
buyLotsOfFruit(orderList)
 function in 
buyLotsOfFruit.py
 which takes a list of 
(fruit,numPounds)
 tuples and returns the cost of your list. If there is some fruit in the list which doesn’t appear in fruitPrices it should print an error message and return None. Please do not change the 
fruitPrices
 variable.




Run
python autograder.py -q q2
until question 2 passes all tests and you get full marks. Each test will confirm that 
buyLotsOfFruit(orderList)
 returns the correct answer given various possible inputs. For example,
 test\_cases/q2/food\_price1.test
 tests whether the cost of 
[('apples', 2.0), ('pears', 3.0), ('limes', 4.0)]
 is 12.25.




 

=== Kapitel: Kapitel 290 ===

4. Task: Shop Smart
Fill in the function 
shopSmart(orderList,fruitShops)
 in 
shopSmart.py
, which takes an 
orderList
 (like the kind passed in to 
FruitShop.getPriceOfOrder
) and a list of 
FruitShop
 and returns the 
FruitShop
 where your order costs the least amount in total. Don’t change the file name or variable names, as otherwisethe autograder will have problems.




Run
python autograder.py -q q3
until question 3 passes all tests and you get full marks. Each test will confirm that 
shopSmart(orderList,fruitShops)
 returns the correct answer given various possible inputs.
