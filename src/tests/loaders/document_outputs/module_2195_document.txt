Module Name: Session 1: What is Machine Learning - Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning

Transcript:
 Hi, and welcome to the first video of the class, which is called What is Machine Learning. So I guess we're not going to answer this question here completely in this, uh, roughly 10 minute video. Instead, we simply want to talk a little bit about what, uh, terms like machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning and statistics mean, and how they relate to each other. So apparently ML is being applied all around us nowadays. It's changing our world considerably. Search engines learn to predict what we want to type in next. Recommended systems can predict our test in books and movies as algorithms doing automatic stock trading. Um, yeah, deep Minds, um, can beat humans at go. Um, and, um, there's these, um, always mentioned, uh, self-driving cars. Um, and here for another negative example, election campaigns, uh, use algorithmically targeted ads to potentially influence voters. And many scientific, uh, areas like physics, biology, and genetics are partially nowadays being transformed into data-driven fields where discoveries are made by, um, pumping huge amounts of data into statistical or ML algorithms. So let's talk a little bit about what, um, these, um, yeah, areas actually mean and how they're defined. So apparently there's AI as a general umbrella term. There's ML as a subfield, and then there's also deep learning. And many people are, I would say at least partially confused what these terms actually mean. So, um, I guess many people equate deep learning completely with ai, and it's also, um, a little bit unclear what all of this has to do with statistics. Okay, let's start with artificial intelligence. So AI is a general term for a quite large and rapidly developing field, and there's really no absolutely strict definition of ai. It's really not impossible to define what it means. I guess. There's, um, quite a few good and standard books out there. Um, but it's a bit difficult to mathematically, um, pinpoint it exactly. It's often used as a term when machines are trained to perform tasks, which until that time could only be solved by humans or which are thought to be quite difficult. And where we assume that the solving of that task would require some form of intelligence, um, whatever that means exactly. And there's a certain paradoxical thing going on that if we solve such a task where we think that problem actually belongs to ai and then we solve it by algorithmic means, then um, after, um, its successful solution by an AI technique, um, we sometimes seem to say, Hey, maybe that, uh, task wasn't so difficult after all, and maybe it didn't really require artificial, uh, didn't, rea didn't really require intelligence, so, um, maybe it wasn't part of AI in the first place. As a question, um, which is a little bit weird, I guess historically speaking, AI started in the 1940s, roughly so around the time of the second World War. Um, the same point in time when the computer and the, uh, theoretical concept of computation was also invented and pioneering scientists, pioneering computer scientists like Turing and John Neuman, um, immediately asked the question when they, uh, yeah, discussed the, uh, formalization of computation. Hey, can we also use that concept of, uh, computation to formalize what we mean, um, by thinking can we use it to, uh, formalize human intelligence or can we use it to, um, automate the process of reasoning? And AI includes quite a very variety of subfields like machine learning, like natural language processing, computer vision, robotics. I guess it's, um, somewhat obvious that these are least connected to ma, but there's also areas like planning and search, um, where historically AI was, uh, much more, um, successful with early on. There's also gameplay and intelligent agents. And I guess if you wanted to have a one sentence definition of ai, you could say it's about the creation of intelligent agents in, I guess, difficult environments nowadays. Um, AI is unfortunately has become somewhat of a hype term and many people use it somewhat improperly, and they use it also in, um, quite, uh, many situations when they sometimes maybe should only say, Hey, I'm, uh, just doing supervised machine learning, or sometimes just doing basic data analysis. So I'm not sure whether actually good idea to say I, I'm doing artificial intelligence when I'm running a simple linear regression. Well, formally it's not, um, untrue. 'cause you could say linear regression is, um, part of machine learning and can be, um, described by its mathematical concepts. And ML is again, a sub part of ai. But on the other hand, we maybe, um, should be a little bit more precise when we are describing what we are doing. Okay. Um, machine learning on the other hand, is a mathematically, quite well-defined area, which also tries to solve reasonably narrow tasks, which are also mathematically, um, easily, I guess, um, describable and definable and machine learning algorithms usually construct predictive or decision making models from data instead of explicitly programming them. And here's one very well known definition, what ML could be from Tom Mitchell from the nineties. So a computer program is set to learn from experience E with respect to some task D and some performance measure P. So It's important that we quantitatively can measure how well our program works if it's performance on T as measured by P improves with experience E. So ML itself as a field can be roughly divided into three subcategories. That supervised learning, which we are mainly studying here with its major forms of classification and regression. There is unsupervised learning with clustering and dimensionality reduction. And then there's also reinforcement learning.
