Course Title: Introduction to Machine Learning Part 1: Foundations
 Course Summary: Machine Learning (ML) is at the core of many applications of artificial intelligence. A key goal of this course series is to teach the fundamental building blocks behind supervised ML. Additional to understanding the theoretical basics, participants will learn how to apply and evaluate different ML algorithms in R and Python with a focus on tabular data. After a general introduction to the basics of ML in part 1/3, participants will get in touch with several learning algorithms in part 2/3. Finally, we will cover the evaluation and tuning of ML models in depth in part 3/3.

Topic Summary: Welcome to the Introduction to Machine Learning! We are Prof. Dr. Bernd Bischl and Dr. Ludwig Bothmann and we are excited that you choose to study Machine Learning with us.  Machine learning (ML) is at the core of many applications of Artificial Intelligence. A key goal of this course series is to teach the fundamental building blocks behind supervised ML. In addition to understanding the theoretical basics, participants will learn how to apply and evaluate different ML algorithms in Python and R with a focus on tabular data. This course is part of a course series that amounts to the content of a one-semester university course. After a general introduction to the basics of ML in part 1, participants will get in touch with several learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors, classification and regression trees, random forests, and neural networks in part 2. Finally, we will cover the evaluation and tuning of ML models in depth in part 3.  This is part 1 - Machine Learning Foundations. We cover the following topics:  Chapter 1: Basic Concepts of Supervised Machine Learning  Chapter 2: Supervised Regression  Chapter 3: Supervised Classification  This course builds on an open-sourced lecture from LMU Munich and shares the learning material with it. The course is targeted at Machine Learning beginners with a basic, university-level education in maths, statistics, and programming. In order to have a good grasp of concepts in this course, it requires a basic understanding of:  Linear algebra: vectors, matrices Multivariate calculus: derivatives, gradients, integrals Probability theory: random variables, distributions, expectation and variance Statistics: not a lot – parameter estimation and linear modeling from a statistics perspective will help but is not required Programming skills in R / Python: We offer all practical exercises in R and in Python, you can choose which language you prefer. In order to solve the programming tasks, you should have basic skills in either R or Python. However, if you are new to programming, you can also skip these exercises and focus more on the theory.  There are two types of certificates that you can obtain  Confirmation of participation: You get this if you access at least 50% of the material. Certificate of achievement: You get this if you achieve at least 60% of the graded quiz questions ("competency check") in the chapters of this course.  Have fun learning!  Let's go

 Topic Summary: None

 Topic Summary: This chapter introduces the basic concepts of Machine Learning. We focus  on supervised learning, explain the difference between regression and  classification, show how to evaluate and compare Machine Learning models  and formalize the concept of learning.

 Topic Summary: This chapter treats the supervised regression task in more detail. We will see different loss functions for regression, how a linear regression model can be used from a Machine Learning perspective, and how to extend it with polynomials for greater flexibility.

 Topic Summary: This chapter treats the supervised classification task in more detail. We will see examples of binary and multiclass classification and the differences between discriminative and generative approaches. In particular, we will address logistic regression, discriminant analysis and naive Bayes classifiers.
