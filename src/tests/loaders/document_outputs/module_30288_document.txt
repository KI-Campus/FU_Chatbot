What is AI?
The science of making machines that:
Think like people
Act like people
Think rationally
Act rationally

--- Page 3 ---

Rational Decisions
▪ We’ll use the term rational in a very specific, technical way:
▪Rational: maximally achieving pre-defined goals
▪Rationality only concerns what decisions are made
(not the thought process behind them)
▪Goals are expressed in terms of the utility of outcomes
▪ Being rational means maximizing your expected utility
A better title for this course would be:
Computational Rationality

--- Page 4 ---

Maximize Your
Expected Utility

What is AI? – Perspectives on Intelligence
Instructor: Prof. Dr. techn. Wolfgang Nejdl

Perspectives on Intelligence
▪Skills-based perspective
▪“A system is only intelligent if it can do [X].”
▪Play chess?
▪Learn from experience?
▪Use words properly?
▪Make mistakes?
▪Not make mistakes?

--- Page 7 ---

Perspectives on Intelligence
▪Embodiment perspective (Rodney Brooks)
Robotics: Science and Systems
Roomba, IRobot

--- Page 8 ---

Perspectives on Intelligence
▪Psychometrics perspective (François Chollet)
▪“Measuring abilities, not skills […] across a broad range of
tasks, including tasks that were previously unknown to the
ability-enabled system and its developers.”
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for
Artificial General Intelligence
On the measure of Intelligence, F. Chollet 2019

--- Page 9 ---

Perspectives on Intelligence
▪Human-compatible perspective (Stuart Russell)
1. Machine’s objective is to maximize human
utility.
2. Initially uncertain about human preferences.
3. Must learn about preferences from human
behavior.

--- Page 10 ---

Perspectives on Intelligence
A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,
butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance
accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give
orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem,
pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight
efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.
—Robert A. Heinlein

--- Page 11 ---

What About the Brain?
Brains (human minds) are very good at making
rational decisions, but not perfect
Brains aren’t as modular as software, so hard to
reverse engineer!
AI may be better than brains at some tasks
“Brains are to intelligence as wings are to flight”
We can’t yet build AI on the scale of the brain
~100T synapses in the human brain vs ~1.8T weights in
GPT4
Still, the brain can be a great inspiration for AI!
Lessons learned from the brain:
memory and simulation are key to decision making

Designing Rational Agents
▪An agent is an entity that perceives and acts.
▪A rational agent selects actions that maximize its
(expected) utility.
▪Characteristics of the percepts, environment, and
action space dictate techniques for selecting rational
actions
▪This course is about:
▪General AI techniques for a variety of problem
types
▪Learning to recognize when and how a new
problem can be solved with an existing technique

Actuators
Environment

1940-1950: Early days: neural and computer science meet
1943: McCulloch & Pitts: Perceptron–boolean circuit model of brain
1950: Turing's “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”
1950—70: Excitement! Logic-driven
1950s: Early AI programs, including Samuel's checkers program, Newell & Simon's Logic Theorist,
Gelernter's Geometry Engine
1956: Dartmouth meeting: “Artificial Intelligence” adopted
1965: Robinson's complete algorithm for logical reasoning
1969: Minsky & Papert: perceptrons can’t learn XOR/parity!
“We propose that a 2-month, 10-man study of artificial intelligence be carried
out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New
Hampshire. The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every
aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so
precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will
be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and
concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve
themselves. We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more
of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together
for a summer.”

What Can AI Do?
Highway surveillance footage from November 24
[2022] shows a Tesla Model S vehicle changing lanes
and then abruptly braking in the far-left lane of the
San Francisco Bay Bridge, resulting in an eight-vehicle
crash.
As traditional car manufacturers enter the electric
vehicle market, Tesla is increasingly under pressure to
differentiate itself. Last year, Musk said that “Full Self-
Driving” was an “essential” feature for Tesla to
develop, going as far as saying, “It’s really the
difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money
or worth basically zero.”

Unintentionally Funny Stories
One day Joe Bear was hungry.  He asked
his friend Irving Bird where some honey
was. Irving told him there was a beehive
in the oak tree.  Joe walked to the oak tree.
He ate the beehive.  The End.
Henry Squirrel was thirsty. He walked over to the
riverbank where his good friend Bill Bird was sitting.
Henry slipped and fell in the river. Gravity drowned.
The End.
Once upon a time there was a dishonest fox and a vain crow. One day the crow was
sitting in his tree, holding a piece of cheese in his mouth.  He noticed that he was holding
the piece of cheese. He became hungry and swallowed the cheese. The fox walked over to
the crow. The End.

AI in the News
Perhaps you’ve heard that there is an exciting new Barack Obama book that everyone’s
talking about! I’m not talking about A Promised Land, the 751-page memoir which Obama
spent four years writing.
No, I’m talking about Barack Obama Book, a 61-page tome by an author named “University
Press.” Why is Barack Obama Book selling so well? Thanks to sponsored listings and canny
search engine optimization, the book appears above Barack Obama’s actual memoir if you
search Amazon for—you guessed it—“barack obama book.”
What is Barack Obama Book? It’s not a book, exactly. It’s an SEO ploy by a shadowy
company that has scores of $2.99 knockoffs ready to be downloaded, from quickie
biographies of au courant figures like Obama, Harris, and Dolly Parton, to obvious
bestseller ripoffs like Caste: A Brief History and Ready Player 3, 2, 1: A Brief History (?).
I don’t think Barack Obama Book was written by a human being, but I do think the A.I. that
excreted it made some decent points about Barack Obama.
