Module Name: Overview

Text: 

In this introductory lecture, we'll set the stage by exploring the 
motivation behind deep learning
 and why it has become such a powerful tool in modern AI. We'll discuss the importance of 
representation learning
 - how deep learning models can automatically discover useful features from raw data - which sets it apart from traditional machine learning approaches.


We'll then introduce the 
basic structure
 of neural networks, and highlight the remarkable flexibility of deep learning models, allowing them to solve a wide range of tasks, from image recognition to natural language processing. Finally, we'll briefly examine the 
history of deep learning
, tracing its roots and how it has evolved into the revolutionary field we know today.
