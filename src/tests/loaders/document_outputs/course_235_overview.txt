Course Title: Foundations of Deep Learning I: Basics
 Course Summary: This is the first part of the Foundations of Deep Learning series, offered by the Machine Learning Lab at the University of Freiburg. In this course, we build a strong foundation in deep learning by exploring its history and core principles. We introduce Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and the fundamental algorithm that enables learning in neural networks: backpropagation. Next, we tackle one of the biggest challenges in deep learning—optimization. You’ll learn why training deep networks is difficult, how to choose and adjust the learning rate, and how popular optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam, and AdamW help models learn efficiently. Finally, we focus on making deep learning models more robust and generalizable. We explore key regularization techniques such as dropout, data augmentation, and ensembling—methods that help prevent overfitting and improve real-world performance.
