      "question": "what is the history of AI",
      "answer": "The history of AI began in 1956 during the Dartmouth workshop, which marked the emergence of AI as a formal discipline. Initially, there was significant optimism about the potential of AI. However, during the 1970s, the field faced the \"AI winter,\" a period of reduced funding and interest. In the 1980s, interest in AI was revived through expert systems, although this too was followed by another slowdown. A major renaissance in AI began around 2012 with advancements in deep learning, notably through the ImageNet challenge. The introduction of transformers in 2017 further advanced the field, leading to the development of large language models such as ChatGPT in 2022.",
